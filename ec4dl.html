<p>Deep Learning methods, generally associated with artificial neural networks, are rising a great deal of interest. In this website we present our view of deep learning and how evolutionary computation can play an important role on it.</p>

<h3><a id="deep-learning" class="anchor" href="#deep-learning" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Deep neural networks</h3>

<p>
From our point of view, four major reasons cause the rising interest in deep neural networks: </p>

<ol>
<li>Great performance: deep neural networks have obtained outstanding performances in computer vision, natural language processing, and speech 
recognition.</li>
<li>Parallelism with human brain: deep neural networks have also raised interest and debate
int the neuroscience world. The debate is mostly centered around whether these networks
are an appropriate model for human brains, and to what extent standard training methods such
as stochastic gradient descent can be useful to reproduce the complex thought processes involved
in human thinking.</li>
<li>The more data, the better: while there is no clear-cut evidence, it would seem that deep neural networks burst their performance with very large datasets. This 
characteristic makes them suitable candidates for big data.</li>
<li>From raw data to labels in one step: let is consider the case of computer vision, neural nets ingest images pixel by pixel, and apply a series of 
transformations that allow higher level information to be learned. This way, the network itself extracts the features relevant from the task at hand. 
By looking at the outputs of individual neurons in the network, it has been shown that they are able to identify not only edges, but also complex 
shapes like faces.</li>
</ol>


<p>Neural networks will, roughly speaking, do the job in almost any machine learning 
problem. Still, it is worth determining when they are the right tool to use. There are two main reasons that can make their use inappropriate. The first is 
that large networks might just be an overkill, presenting a great training overhead. The second case is readability and interpretability. In many domains,
from medicine to economy, the prediction itself can be almost as important as the reasoning that lead to make it. In this sense, neural networks, 
while they are not black boxes, are highly complex models that are hardly interpretable by humans.</p>


<p>We are particularly interested in the last point (point 4). Automating or even skipping the feature extraction process can have a huge impact in many domains since it will enable us to tackle way more prediction problems. The question we seek to answer with this project is, can we automatically find high level yet interpretable features? These features could then be used both to tackle prediction problems, and to provide feedback to domain experts. Such feedback will arguably be helpful to understand the problems associated with their data. For instace, doctors could identify new conditions associated with a given disease.</p>

<p>Let is first clarify what we mean by interpretable. We are interested in symbolic and readable representations of the features, very much like functions or formulas, decision lists, or decision trees.<p>
