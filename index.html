<p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<a id="deep-learning" class="anchor" href="#deep-learning" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Deep Learning</h3>

<p>Deep Learning methods, generally associated with Neural Networks, are rising a great deal of interest. 
From our point of view, three major reasons cause this interest: </p>

<ol>
<li>Great performance: Deep Neural Networks have obtained outstanding performances in computer vision, natural language processing, and speech 
recognition.</li>
<li>Parallelism with human brain: Deep Neural Networks have also raised interest and debate
int the neuroscience world. The debate in this case is mostly centered around whether these networks
are an appropriate model for human brains, and to what extent standard training methods such
as stochastic gradient descent can be useful to reproduce the complex thought processes involved
in human thinking.</li>
<li>The more data, the better: </li>
<li>From raw data to labels in one step: let is consider the case of computer vision, these learning methods ingest images pixel by pixel, and apply a series of nonlinear 
transformations that allow higher level information to be learned. This way, the network itself extract the features relevant from the task at hand. 
By looking at the outputs of individual neurons in the network, it has been shown that they are able to identify find not only edges, but also complex 
shapes like faces.</li>
</ol>

<p>We are particularly interested in the last point. Automating or even skipping the feature extraction process can have a huge impact in many domains.<p>



<p>While neural networks will, roughly speaking, do the job in almost any machine learning 
problem, it is worth determining when they are the right tool to use. There are two main reasons that can make their use inappropriate. The first is 
that large networks might just be an overkill, presenting a great training overhead. The second case is readability and interpretability. In many domains,
from medicine to economy, the prediction itself can be almost as important as the reasoning that lead to make it. In this sense, neural networks, 
while they are not black boxes, they are highly complex models that are hardly interpretable by humans.</p>


<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
